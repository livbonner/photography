	<p><em>Photography By Des Magness</em></p>
	<p><em>Liv Bonner is a fine artist and writer pursuing a BFA in Fine Arts from Parsons School of Design as well as a BA in Journalism at The New School.</em></p>
	<p>I tell myself that my work deals with my identification as a young woman, a young artist and as an ever-contradictory human. Yet, these so-called aspects of my identity, too, find themselves to be uncertain aspirations just as all the rest.</p>
	<P>I am, rather, dealing with an identification as an aspiring youthful woman, an aspiring artist, an aspiring human worthy of connection. I am dealing with claiming an identity worthy of relaying its thoughts to the world, let alone defining itself as much of anything.</P>
	<p>I am not a woman without the expectations; I am not an artist without the work to prove it and I am not a human without a definition to latch onto.</p>
